# Kim's Layers of Love
Custom Cakes, Cupcakes and More

 A new, home based bakery business named "Kim's Layers of Love" "Cakes, Cupcakes and More" is the focus of my Code Kentucky Capstone Project. With the business owner's 
 colabaration, I'm building a website for her new business. It is an exciting, real world application of the skills learned and learning through my 
 Code Kentucky experience. Building this website from html, css and JavaScript vs a website template has been not only exciting but, as well, has been rewarding watching 
 the website develop. This endeavor will allow the webite to continue to grow and improve along side Kim's business.
 
 Three features I've included from the requirements list are:
 
  • A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes
  
  • Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code
    
  • Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views
